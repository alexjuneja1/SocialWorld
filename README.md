<u><font size="20"><b>Social World by Linc</b></font></u>

Ever had a great thought and wish you knew other people who felt the same? Well wish no more! Social World allows user to find each other or find out how trendy their hashtags are by visually seeing it across the globe!

Technologies Used:

+ Node version 4.1.1
+ Express version 4.13.3
+ MongoDB
+ Passport (Local, Facebook, & Twitter)
+ Mongoose
+ EJS
+ Three-JS
+ Bootstrap
+ Semantic-UI

Users will be able to search a hashtag and find how geographically relevant it is with a single keystroke. The text is found through matching the latitude and longitude from the location of the post. Depending on how popular it is in a certain area, the magnitude is increased and the display becomes more prominent in that area.

Social World runs on a "Chrome Experiment" known as WebGL, which allows developers to manipulate a globe view in order to display data in geographical form. Users also have the ability to log into the application itself, whether it is an account designed locally or an account created through Facebook. Users can construct their own personalized profile for the website. 

Users can currently:
  + Insert hashtags into a search container.
  + Receive both textual and geographical information based on the search term.
  + Create a user account.
  + Log into the user account.
  + Establish a profile into the application.
  + Log into the application through Facebook.

As far as backlog is currently concerned:
  + A way to display a user's profile to another user.
  + A method of storing searchs per user.

<u><b>Using the App</b></u><br>
Using Social World is easy! Simply type in a hashtag or keyword into the search bar and you're on your way.
