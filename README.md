Social World by Linc

// Ever had a great thought and wish you knew other people who felt the same? Well wish no more! Social World allows user to find each other or find out how trendy their hashtags and witty phrases are by visually seeing it across the globe! //

// Users will be able to search a hashtag and find how geographically relevant it is with a single keystroke. The text is found through matching the latitude and longitude from the location of the post. Depending on how popular it is in a certain area, the magnitude is increased and the display becomes more prominent in that area. //

// Social World runs on a "Chrome Experiment" known as WebGL, which allows developers to manipulate a globe view in order to display data in geographical form. It takes advantages of effects built on jQuery as well as packages from node.js in the back-end. Design elements are taken from both bootstrap (most specifically in the navigation bar) and Semantic-UI. //
